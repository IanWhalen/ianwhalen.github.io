I guess Burp Castle doesn't have the breadth of selection that some bars like DBA might have, but its still hard to believe that Gridskipper managed to leave so fantastic a bar off their <a href="http://gridskipper.com/347028/belgian-beer-bars-in-new-york">list of Belgian beer bars in New York</a>.

* Free pomme frites on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday?  Check.
* Regularly rotating selection of good and varied beers?  Check.
* Bartenders dressed in monks robes?  Check.
* Volume so loud you have to scream your conversations? Nope.
