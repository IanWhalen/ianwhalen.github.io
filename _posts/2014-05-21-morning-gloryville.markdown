The good news is that a few co-workers and I made it into the [Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303627504579557751834704592).  The bad news is that we made it into a fluff piece for going to a pre-work party, Morning Gloryville, as opposed to any major work accomplishments.  I can only hope this won't be the pinnacle of my news-worthy accomplishments in life.

On the fun side, pictures of me ended up in the web and print editions:

But of course, reality crashes in when they use the worst possible picture:

Looking forward to the next [Morning Gloryville](https://www.facebook.com/morninggloryvillenyc) on June 18th!
