There aren't many times when I can claim to be ahead of the curve on new music.  I don't think I started listening to New York dance-rock until years after it broke.  I just started listening to LCD Soundsystem some 6 months after _Sound of Silver_ came out.  And even my fondness for Daft Punk, dating back to 8th or 9th grade, is going to have to be counted a fluke unless people start rediscovering the genius of <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=eiAorKe6cpM">Rabbit In The Moon</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=GCoCTkC0oL0">Future Sound of London</a> too.

With this in mind, I was amazed to learn in the past year that Andrew Bird is a widely respected independent musician, since he was the first artist I ever saw in concert.  I was 14.

I suppose it might be less impressively hip that I was there to see Squirrel Nut Zippers (this was at the height of the <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=knW1hGwmEXQ">Gap-inspired</a> commercial swing revival) and that I was there with my mother (I _was_ 14).  But I was impressed enough with his performance as an opener for the opener that I walked away from The Electric Factory with a copy of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrills_%28album%29">Thrills</a></em>.

Since then the Squirrel Nut Zippers have dissolved and faded into obscurity while Bird has ascended as a respected musician in his own right.  Unfortunately, _<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Armchair-Apocrypha-Andrew-Bird/dp/B000MV9A1C">Armchair Apocrypha</a>_ didn't rate nearly as high as I expected it to on the end-of-year lists I have read.  Even so I am excited to have rediscovered him after so many years, and I look forward to catching him in concert the next time he comes through New York.  I'll probably even go with my mother just for old times' sake.
