*   [Off The Grid: Risk Black Ops and Hasbro's Wrong Direction]()

    Can't agree more with this - I totally would have bought this based on 
    graphic design alone...

*   [Pitchfork.tv: Vampire Weekend: Secret Session, Columbia University](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/48547-vampire-weekend-secret-session-columbia-university)
    
    And so everything comes full circle...

*   [Sigur Ros - 2008 Tour Dates (NYC Included)](http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2008/05/sigur_ros_2008.html)
    
    Presale disappeared in seconds, so i''m assuming getting regular tickets
    will be nearly impossible too...

*   [Bus Transfer](http://wvs.topleftpixel.com/08/05/06/)

    I'm thinking of putting letterboxing on my own photos for the fun shot of 
    melodrama it adds to everything...

*   [Clay Shirky on Cognitive Surplus](http://laughingsquid.com/clay-shirky-on-cognitive-surplus/)

    I too will start using "One Wikipedia Project" as a unit of measurement 
    now...
