I spent all of my lunch break trying to figure out how to get the <a href="http://wasabi.pbwiki.com/Related%20Entries">Wasabi Related Posts</a> plugin to work properly and only managed to screw my entire page up behind repair, forcing a reinstall of the Wordpress theme I am using.

I think I deleted a quotation mark somewhere, causing the font to grow bigger as I scrolled down the page.

The mySQL database update necessary for the plugin was easy enough, but it turns out getting the php call "?php related_posts(); ?" into your Wordpress loop so that the links come out with bullet points and prefaced by "Related Posts" is nearly impossible.

I'll put a bit more thought into this process after work before I throw the towel in and move on to a different plugin.
