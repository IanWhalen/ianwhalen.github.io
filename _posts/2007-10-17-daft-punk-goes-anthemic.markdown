title: Daft Punk Goes Anthemic

There were a lot of highlights at Daft Punk's Keyspan Park show in August.  It might be a touch dramatic to describe that night as a _<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesamtkunstwerk">gesamtkunstwerk</a>_ but the robotic duo definitely brought a show that was more than the sum of its parts.  One of my favorite moments was their new remix of "Harder Better Faster Stronger".  It was tinged with a more acid synth line and set off by a more trancey bass line.  Combined with some well-placed samples from "Around The World" it absolutely tore the roof off.  (Granted, there was no roof to begin with, but I think my point is clear.)

Although the artists allowed anyone to come and film the concert, it was insinuated after the tour that there would be no concert DVD.  That was a bit of a letdown, but Daft Punk has come through with the next best thing, a live concert album.  Right now the lead single, that very remix of "Harder Better Faster Stronger" I was so enamored with, is only available on the French iTunes <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=265449982&s=143442">here</a>.  But for people on the cheap, the good folks at <a href="http://www.discobelle.net">Discobelle</a> have it up to check out here: <a href="http://www.discobelle.net/2007/10/16/alive-2007/">"Harder Better Faster Stronger (Alive 2007)"</a>.  The usual music blog disclaimers apply.
