After almost two years of working anywhere between 35 and 75 hours a week, I find it interesting to reflect on what wears me down and what doesn't.  The nights of working past 4 AM, thankfully themselves few and far between, don't bother me much.  I'm not sure if its a low-intensity adrenaline rush or just the interruption to the routine, but even a series of high intensity deadlines to be met doesn't do much to interrupt my schedule outside of work.

The schedule that wears me down most is definitely the current one, working consistently until about 10 PM roughly 4 nights a week.  That schedule has been going on 3 months for my current project, and the amount of work crammed between 9 AM and 10 PM has only increased over the course of that time.

Ending work at 10 on a regular basis isn't terrible though.  If something especially interesting comes up early on in the night, a quick change of clothes and cab ride to Brooklyn is usually all it takes to join the party.  The most disappointing nights, tragically, are those when I leave work early at 6, when I have some hope of doing my taxes, of going to a concert.  I usually end up in bed by 9.
