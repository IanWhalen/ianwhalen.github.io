title: Of Cryptonomicon, Conflux, And Concrete Crickets

I don't trust art.  "High art," specifically, although I'm willing to cede that it is a fairly ignorant position.  (Not ignorant in the sense that all who mistrust what I classify as high art are ignorant, but ignorant in that I don't really know enough to have a position, but have adopted one anyway.)

Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon contains many discursions, and one of the more memorable even after all these years is his prison-cell lecture by Enoch Root about the difference between the gods of war, Athena and Ares.  One meme Root (or rather Stephenson) mentions is the idea of _metis_, a greek word for "art", but which is specific in describing art as craft and technology.  It was a distinction that I had never heard made so clearly, and is one which stuck with me for some time.

So it is with great pleasure that I have seen the rise of interest in craft over or alongside art.  When a magazine like [Make](http://www.makezine.com) is as popular (internet-popular, at least) as it is now, and when Theo Jansen gives a [talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/162) at TED, I think its fair to say that craft is cool.

Straddling the line between art and craft is the [Conflux Festival](http://confluxfestival.org/conflux2007/).  It is back, starting today and going through Sunday.  Conflux seems to have enough ties to the academic/artistic theory that so tempers my interest, but more than makes up for this with a heavy dose of projects that can only be described as awesome.

One artist involved this year (by whom I was fortunate enough to see a preview talk at the inestimable [DorkBot](http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotnyc)) is Michael Dory, whose [Concrete Crickets](http://www.doryexmachina.com/projects/concrete-crickets/) will be on display Friday through Sunday.  Check his work out if you get a chance.

_(Note: It has been several years at best since I've read Stephenson's magnum opus, so its possible my memory of what was in it is completely fabricated.  I'm just warning you.)_
