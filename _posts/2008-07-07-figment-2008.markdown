Last week the Action Arts League, in conjunction with [some](http://lowconcept.blogspot.com) [friends](http://kostumekult.com) of mine, organized the second annual <a href="http://figmentnyc.org">FIGMENT</a> arts festival.  With the exception of some late-day rain on Saturday, which I managed to avoid by leaving early, it was a beautiful day and the whole event seemed to go off amazingly well.

[Groovehoops](http://www.groovehoops.com) provided hoola hoops for the dance "floor", Kostume Kult gave out costumes to kids, and there were sculptures and active installations all over the island.  My only real regret? I failed to hit the mini-golf course.  Maybe next year.
