title: Stock Options Calculator

For some time now I've been relying on [a slightly hacky and very much home-grown spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cbkz6XeEZqtj7qovlT2CowTJcNgIlbkFgHqDvG5gLhU/) to calculate the approximate value of my accrued stock options.  Originally built to help me think about the "to 83b or not to 83b" decision, it hasn't been updated in a few years.  I now rely on it mostly as a method to consider the option/salary tradeoff.

I've shared it with a few coworkers, but only ever on a 'please don't rely _just_ on this' basis since I've always been nervous of there being some major misstep in my thought process.  In the hopes that someone might stumble across it and offer a few tips, I've made the doc commentable and embedded a read-only version of it below.  Anyone so inclined can [click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cbkz6XeEZqtj7qovlT2CowTJcNgIlbkFgHqDvG5gLhU/) and add their thoughts.

As a companion piece/primer on options, I also highly recommend [this article by Max Schireson](http://maxschireson.com/2011/08/23/startup-stock-options-explained/), my former CEO at MongoDB - he does a good job of both explaining the core concepts and making concrete suggestions on how to discuss the topic with potential employers.
