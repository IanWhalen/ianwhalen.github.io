title: My Cheap DIY Lightbox

In a fit of DIY madness this past week I embarked on quite possibly the easiest homebrew project imaginable.  It all started out as a cardboard box and a few sheets of tracing paper as seen here:

And these simple components magically assembled themselves into a fully functioning lightbox as seen here:

Much thanks to [Strobist](http://strobist.blogspot.com) for the idea.  Without even owning an off-camera flash I was able to position my lightbox in view of the sun and get one or two good pictures of [My Little Cthulhu](http://dreamlandtoyworks.com/my_little_cthulhu.html)

Those pictures:
