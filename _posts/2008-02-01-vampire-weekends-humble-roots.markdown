> As some of you may know I have a new band with ROSTAM, CHRIS and CHRIS called VAMPIRE WEEKEND (yes it has the same name as the forthcoming film). We played our second ever show last Saturday at the Columbia RELAY 4 LIFE. It was a very positive experience.

I am so in love with modern technology.  It's amazing to look back and follow the footprints that a band has left across the internet from its inception, as pasted above from lead singer Ezra's old blog <a href="http://internetvibes.blogspot.com/2006_03_01_archive.html">here</a>, then through one of its earliest performances, as recorded below, and on to the charts at iTunes and Amazon.

I'm sure there are many other bands besides Vampire Weekend for which you can follow a trail of bread crumbs across the internet as it has developed, but I think this is probably the only one which took its name from something this awesome:
