title: Another Take On The Art Parade
category: posts
---

<a href="http://www.artobserved.com">Art Observed</a> did a quick review of the Deitch Projects' Art Parade that made explicit a few of the thoughts I had, in addition to making a comparison with the Chelsea scene I had not thought of.  More importantly, however, they used a few of my pictures for their post.

Its heartening to see someone who isn't obligated to smile and nod give an indication that they think my pictures aren't absolutely terrible.
