title: The Cell Director Is Back With The Fall

Newly and and not a bit obnoxiously single-named director Tarsem (nÃ©e Tarsem Singh) appears finally to have crawled out of post-production/distributor hell with his second movie, _[The Fall](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460791)_, thanks to the help of David Fincher and Spike Jonze.

I still remember _The Cell_ as a fairly conventional speculative-fiction thriller draped in absolutely beautiful set designs, and the result was far more entertaining than it had any right to be.  As an aside, it is also [one](ttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209958) of only [two](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120780/) movies I've seen in which I liked Jennifer Lopez.

I'm glad to see this is finally getting released, even if so many years after its festival premiere.  I do, however, have a sneaking suspicion that the unremarkable plotting of The Cell is the only lifeline which kept the audience from visually drowning in a sea of red and purple silk ribbons.  Now that he's unchained from a studio script, I anticipate Tarsem has created something without even that narrative link to reality.  That could be either a very good thing or a very bad thing.
