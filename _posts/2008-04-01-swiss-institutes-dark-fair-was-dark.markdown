Despite having a tiny space compared to the number of people standing outside, <a href="http://www.swissinstitute.net">Swiss Institute</a> pulled off a fairly quiet and unique anti-Armory type show on the 28th of March.  Going along with the theme of the evening, I thought it would be unfair to use a flash if the artists themselves weren't allowed natural or electric light.  Turns out I should have allowed for a slightly longer exposure.  Whoops.

Also in one of the more poorly-played moments of the evening, I excused myself from a conversation with an artist exhibiting that night to return a missed call from a potential employer.  Of course, as soon as I called I was told that I had misread the recent calls screen on my phone; I was the one who had accidentally dialed said potential employer from my pocket in the first place.  Between the embarrassing phone call and the conversation unfortunately cut short, I don't think I've failed so hard in recent memory.  Double whoops.
