title: I Hate Myself But I Still Hate HTML Too

In a stunning insight that I'm sure they teach you on the first day of HTML school, I realized why I was having so much trouble getting a "Related Posts" plugin working.

I couldn't figure out why pages remained the same even after I was pulling all of the code out of them.  Equally frustrating was when they started changing at random a few minutes later.  I forgot I had the wp-cache program running, which caused the delay between changes to the code being made and changes to the pages displaying.

Once I disabled that and cleared the cache, every change I made was instantly recognized.  Getting the formatting set took only a few short minutes after that.

Whew.

Unfortunately, I reinstalled most of my wordpress theme files in an attempt to troubleshoot this, which means I lost my personalized page banners.  Hopefully it shouldn't take too long to recrop them and reup them sometime tomorrow.

Lesson learned?  Backup everything.  And don't be an idiot.
